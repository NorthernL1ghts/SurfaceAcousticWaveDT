# Surface Acoustic Wave Data Transfer

![Surface Acoustic Wave Data Transfer LOGO](Resources/Branding/LOGO.png)

## Overview

The **Surface Acoustic Wave Data Transfer System** is an innovative approach to secure, offline, and high-speed data transmission. By utilizing ultrasonic Surface Acoustic Waves (SAWs), this system enables direct point-to-point communication without relying on conventional wireless or wired networks. It's designed to be environmentally friendly, non-interfering, and safe for both humans and animals.

## Key Features

  - **Offline & Air-Gapped Operation**: Functions independently of the internet and cellular networks.
  - **High-Speed Data Transfer**: Adjustable pitch modulation allows for variable data transfer rates.
  - **Secure Communication**: Employs pseudo-randomized encoding to ensure data integrity and prevent interception.
  - **Environmentally Safe**: Non-electromagnetic and non-ionizing, posing no harm to living organisms or existing technologies.
  - **Multi-Format Support**: Capable of transmitting various file types, including documents, images, and videos.

## System Architecture

The system operates through a multi-stage process:

1.  **Digital Data Encoding**: Converts binary data into a suitable format for mechanical transmission.
2.  **Mechanical Wave Generation**: Utilizes piezoelectric substrates and Interdigital Transducers (IDTs) to generate SAWs.
3.  **Wave Propagation**: Transmits the mechanical waves through the medium.
4.  **Wave Reception**: Captures the propagated waves using a receiving IDT.
5.  **Signal Decoding**: Converts the received mechanical waves back into digital data.

## Applications

  - **Secure Local Data Transfer**: Ideal for environments where data security is paramount.
  - **Covert Communication Channels**: Suitable for military, intelligence, or corporate applications requiring discreet communication.
  - **Medical Equipment Integration**: Facilitates data transfer in medical settings, such as MRI systems, without interference.
  - **Neuroengineering**: Potential applications in brain-computer interfaces and assistive technologies for conditions like Motor Neuron Disease (MND).
  - **High-Density Environments**: Enables data transfer in areas with congested wireless networks.

## Development Environment

### Programming Languages

  - **Python**: Used for prototyping and simulation of the data transfer process.
  - **C++**: Implemented for the actual data transfer system to ensure performance and efficiency.

### Dependencies

  - **GLFW**: A library for creating windows with OpenGL contexts and managing input.
  - **Dear ImGui**: A bloat-free graphical user interface library for C++.
  - **ImPlot**: A plotting library for creating interactive plots within ImGui.
